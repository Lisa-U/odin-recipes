        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I'm not sure if this is going to be good or not, but boy did it come up near the top of the recipe list on <a href=https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/231248/pizza-chicken/>AllRecipes.com!</a></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup italian bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 TBSP lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices pepperoni, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl; place flour into a second bowl. Whisk egg and lemon juice together in a third bowl.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Dip each chicken breast in egg mixture and dredge in flour; dip again in egg mixture and dredge chicken in crumb mixture until coated. Place coated chicken breasts into a baking dish.</li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is heated through and crumbs are golden, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Spoon 2 tablespoons pizza sauce onto each chicken breast, sprinkle each with half the mozzarella cheese, and top each with half the pepperoni slices.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
